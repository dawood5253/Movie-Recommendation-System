## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that can suggest movies to users based on their preferences. This is achieved using collaborative filtering methods, which leverage user-item interactions to make recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is assumed to be a CSV file containing user ratings for various movies. Commonly used datasets for such tasks include the MovieLens dataset.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed. Additionally, you need to install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb
   ```

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load and display the dataset from a CSV file.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Train a collaborative filtering model using techniques such as matrix factorization.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Recommendations**: Generate movie recommendations for users based on the trained model.

## Results

The notebook provides a detailed workflow for building and evaluating a movie recommendation system. The results section includes evaluation metrics and examples of movie recommendations for different users.
